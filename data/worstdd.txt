These two tables shows the for PGP and the benchmark portfolio of at least 10%. In addition, we show the number of months took to reach the low (To Trough) and to recover. The lesson from this is that PGP offers some downside protection, but one should still expect losses. The risk can reduced by always increasing the allocation to bonds. While this should reduce the risk, it will also reduce the expected return because we expect stocks to outperform bonds.
