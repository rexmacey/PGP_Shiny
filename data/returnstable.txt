This table shows returns for PGP both gross and net of a 0.10% trading cost. That cost is reasonable in todayâ€™s market although it likely would have been higher historically. The goal of this analysis is not to come up with what an investor would have experienced in the past, but to approximate what he or she might expect should we encounter similar markets in the future. Unless otherwise stated, the returns for PGP are net.  Returns for the benchmark portfolios do not incorporate trading costs though some would be required to rebalance to the target allocations or to reinvest income.   Returns for periods exceeding a year are annualized.
