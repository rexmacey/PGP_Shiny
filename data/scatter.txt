How to read the scatterplots. These scatterplots are powerful images for investigating the relationship between the portfolios (PGP and benchmark) and the S&P Index. The horizontal (x-axis) position of each point (dot) represents the annualized return of the S&P. The vertical shows the portfolio performance (left chart is PGP, right is benchmark). The shading indicates the ending year of the performance with lighter shading used for earlier periods and heavier for more recent. The red line is a reference to the return of the S&P. Points above the line indicate higher performance and points below indicate lower. We’d like to see is something like a hockey stick. When the market is down (points to the left of zero, the gray vertical line), we’d like returns more in line with cash suggesting protection. When the market is up (right side), we’d like to be close to the red line suggesting participation.
