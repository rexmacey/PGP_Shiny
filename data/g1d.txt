This chart shows the hypothetical growth of $1. The scale on the vertical axis is calibrated so that equal vertical distances represent equal rates of return.  

While over some long periods, such as Dec-1925 through Oct-2018, PGP is ahead at the end, we believe one should be prepared for long term returns below that of the market. PGP tends to add value during protracted bear markets such as 1929-1932, 1973-1974, 2000-2003, and 2008-2009.  It did not help in the brief crash of Oct-1987.
